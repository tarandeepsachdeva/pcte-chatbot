## ðŸš€ Setup Instructions

### 1. Create & Activate Conda Environment with PyTorch
Make sure you have **Anaconda/Miniconda** installed.

```bash
# Create a new conda environment with Python 3.8 (recommended)
conda create -n chatbot python=3.8 -y

# Activate the environment
conda activate chatbot

# Install PyTorch (CPU version, change if GPU available)
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cpuonly -c pytorch
```

---

### 2. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 3. Run the Project
After installing dependencies, you can run the chatbot.

```bash
python train.py    # To train the chatbot model
python chat.py     # To start chatting with the bot
```
